# socket-communication-keylogger
simple keylogger using socket communication between a host and a client

USAGE:
Open both client and host solutions in Visual Studio and compile, or otherwise compile source code directly.

To start, run the host program first, then the client program. 

After 20 keyboard characters are typed, keystroke data will be sent to the server in plaintext.

To enable stealth features on the client, enable the labeled section in initOverlay().

This is a simple excercise in socket communication. I do not condone any malicious use of this program.
Certaub features have been left out intentionally to prevent malicious use and to enable antivirus detection of this program.

For any questions, send me a message on my discord.
